            <h1> All About Rex Orange County</h1> 
            
            <p>Alex O'Connor, better known as Rex Orange County, is a talented singer/songwriter known for his music. As a teenager he had a passion for music and was self-taught. He learned to play the drums, electric guitar, piano, and production software skills. His music is a mix of bedroom pop, jazz, hip-hop, and soul influences. O'Connor was only a teen when he first gained online attention in 2015 for his self-produced album "bcos u will never be free." Later in 2017, he released "Apricot Princess" which cracked the Top Ten of Billboard's Independent Albums chart. This eventually paved the way for his newest album "Pony" that released in October 2019. <br> <br> Alex gained recognition from other artists aswell. In 2017, Tyler the Creator featured O'Connor on two tracks from his "Flower Boy" album. In that same year he released popular singles like "Best Friend" and "Sunflower". His new album "Pony" landed him number one on the Billboard Top Rock and Alternative Albums charts. <br> <br> I personally enjoy Rex's music because it mixes many genres like hip-hop, bedroom pop and indie. His songs are relateable, some being more upbeat than others. I honestly think he dosen't have any bad songs. I even had the opportunity to experience one of his concerts in Feburary 2020. He had amazing energy and had an awesome perosnality. Rex Orange County continues to thrive and grow into an amazing artist.  </p>
